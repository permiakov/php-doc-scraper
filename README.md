# php.net-doc-scraper
When i was preparing to ZCE examination, i used Anki for memorizing the material. Once i tired from creating cards for PHP functions and classes and decided to write a simple helper.  

Script can help you with:
- scrape needed section of information from php.net (web version of php.net docs or from downloadable archived html version)
- create CSV file from scraped data (styled with HTML and CSS) compatible with 
<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#html">Anki import HTML</a> that can help you to improve learning of PHP (for example ZCE examination)
